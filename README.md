## Overview
This is my first project that i made that without any course or help! This project is very simply but it's  very excited for me because i code it by own with HTML &amp; CSS. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements. 
-

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important things that i learned in this project was:

- How to have hover image with opacity and have a icon in the center of image. 
- Adding transform and absolute position to have a element in the center of div, section, etc. 
- Adding transition to hover psuedo element for more charm.
